                  Teeny Tiny Explorers was created with parents and children in mind. Today it can be so easy to fall into the trap of technology being a child's primary experiences. 
                  The days of exploring the outdoors and learning about nature hands on, seem to continue to fade faster than we would every wish. Teeny Tiny Explorers was created with parents in mind. Parents that want to find new and exciting ways to connect with their child and get outside. Teeny Tiny Explorers is not a group that meets only in the summer, and perfect weather. 
                  This group is focused on trying our best in any season.
